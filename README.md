# Food Ordering Website FrontEnd
This project is mainly focused on creating simple to use, clean, attractive,
fully responsive front end user interface which can be used with in any backend
system.

## Technical Overview
This project is built based on basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Also, I have used [Swiper CDN](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/Swiper) in this project to get swiping cards for the 
different food items in menu section and also for the user review cards.
